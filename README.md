"Deep" is my working title for a 3D OpenGL based game written around "FunC", 
a VM implementing an experimental implementation of Bob Nystrom's toy language 
"lox" as described in his unpublished book at craftinginterpreters.com

The current status of this project is best described as "highly experimental"
and the code quality clearly reflects my inexperience with C++

You are hereby granted permission to use the source code in any way you wish
as long as you understand that under no circumstances must it be anywhere near
an actual production environment or brought upon innocent users.
